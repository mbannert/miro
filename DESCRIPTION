Description: Description: miro is an R package that helps useRs to store meta
    information without affecting the original objects (except for a key
    attribute). Miro stores all meta information in a separate environment. The
    package uses reference classes to store the actual meta information. The
    actual data is not part of the meta information. Thus meta information can
    easily be exported as a bundle and be shared without privacy concerns.
